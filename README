This is a batch scheme to run a set of gaussian or qchem jobs.

All you need to do is to generate a config interface and batch it.

There are about several input groups should be specified in the interface to handle different type of batch jobs.

Groups         Label                  Added keywords
 Env_1)        "__project__ ::"       "ProjDir"  "ProjCtrl"

 Env_2)        "__title__ ::"

 Env_3)        "__macro_path__ ::"

 Gau_4)        "__gaussian__ ::"

 Qch_5)        "__qchem__ ::"        "ParaOrSer" "QchCfg"

 Bat_6)        "__batch__ ::"        "NMole"

 Train_7)      "__energy__ ::"       "NEngy" "SEngy"

 Train_8)      "__polar__  ::"       "NResp" "SResp*3"

 Train_9)      "__nmr__    ::"       "NNMR"  "SNMR"

 Train_10)     "__geom__    ::"       "NGeom" "SGeom*3"

 Aim_11)       "__aims__   ::"       "Procs"   "AimsCFG"

 Aim_12)       "__aims_basis__ ::"

NOTE :
       A)   Annotation is allowed, begining by '#'.
       B)   upper and lower cases are identical.
       C)   Since the program rewinds the config file before searching required group, the group order is immaterial.
       D)   Spaces or commas may be used to separate items.
