1) CMD      :: gaussian2qchem.csh 
   USAGE    :: change gaussian input file in current DIR to qchem input file


=============================
2) CMD     :: mcp_batch.py proj_name [options] ...
   USAGE   :: collect useful data from an existed project to an new project.
              If the directions of the new project exist, they do not be copied again
              "scf_guess = read" is added into "rem" block automatically, 
              using the converged wavefunctions obtained from previous project.
2a)CMD     :: mcp_batch_input_only.py proj_name [options] ...
   USAGE   :: collect useful data from an existed project to an new project.
              Do not copy the chk file from previous project into the current project
              So "scf_guess = read" isn't added by default.

   OPTION  :: -o, --original
                 the main DIR of the exisited project.
                 default one is 'B3LYP'
              -b, --basis
                 the basis set for the new project, relating to the Q-Chem key of 'basis'.
              -m, --method
                 the method used for the new project, relating to the Q-Chem key of 'exchange'.
              -af, --appendfile
                 the file contains the keys which needs append to batch control file
              -jf, --jobflag,  e.g. energy|pt21|pt22|nmr....
                 the flag tells batch what you need to collect from the Q-Chem output file.
              -cfg, default = rmp2
                 the flag to choose a specific version of Q-Chem, relating to the Q-Chem global variable 'QCCFG'.
              -par, default is turn on
                 to run Q-Chem using 8 process in a node. This is the default running mode
              -ser, default is turn off
                 to run Q-Chem using 1 process in a node.
